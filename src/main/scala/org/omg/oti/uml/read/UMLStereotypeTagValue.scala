/**
 * An abstraction for the value of a stereotype "tag property".
 *
 * The UML specification avoids defining an abstract syntax for
 * instances of stereotypes and values of stereotype "tag properties".
 * The motivation is to avoid over-committing the specification and provide
 * flexibility for implementing the UML specification.
 *
 * This unfortunately results in a specification that is very complicated
 * to understand and that allows multiple interpretations of the Profile mechanism.
 * In particular, see UML 2.5, section 12.3.3, Semantics, Profiles:
 *
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * A Profile can define or import Classes, Associations, DataTypes,
 * PrimitiveTypes and Enumerations as well as Stereotypes.
 * More precisely all the constraints of a CMOF-compliant metamodel apply to a UML Profile.
 * These are defined in detail in Section 14.4 of the MOF Core Specification.
 * The effect of these constraints is that, except for Stereotypes and Extensions,
 * all other Types defined or imported in a Profile must be exactly one of
 * the Types explicitly mentioned in the above subset and that no specialization outside
 * this subset is allowed.
 * The term Profile-defined Type corresponds to a CMOF-compliant Class, Association,
 * DataType, PrimitiveType or Enumeration defined or imported in a Profile.
 *
 * Profile-defined Types can only be used as the type of Properties
 * in that Profile or as a general classifier of another Profile-defined Type.
 * They cannot be used as Types in models the Profile is applied to,
 * such as the type of a TypedElement, the classifier of an InstanceSpecification or
 * the general or specific classifier in a Generalization relationship.
 * It is however possible to define these types in separate Packages and
 * import them as needed in both Profiles and model Packages in order to use them for both purposes.
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * What are these purposes?
 *
 * Unfortunately, the UML 2.5 specification did not clarify what the purposes are
 * nor how they are affected by the semantics of Profiles.
 *
 * The UML 2.5 specification should clarify the different purposes
 * for the type of a stereotype property that is:
 *
 * - a scalar datatype:
 * the value is semantically equivalent to a literal specification
 * (the value is tied to the lifecycle of applying/unapplying a profile)
 *
 * - a structured datatype:
 * the value is semantically equivalent to an instance specification with slot/values for
 * individual attributes of the datatype
 * (the value is tied to the lifecycle of applying/unapplying a profile)
 *
 * - a metaclass:
 * the value is an element in the model that is unaffected by applying/unapplying a profile
 *
 * - a stereotype:
 * the value is an instance of a stereotype applied to an element; this value is tied
 * to the lifecycle of applying/unapplying a profile
 *
 * - a class or association:
 * The 2nd paragraph above implies that an instance of such a class or association could
 * be either in the model or part of the lifecycle of applying/unapplying a profile
 *
