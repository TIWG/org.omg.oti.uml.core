/**
 * An abstraction for managing stereotype application.
 *
 * The UML specification avoids defining an abstract syntax for
 * instances of stereotypes and values of stereotype "tag properties".
 * The motivation is to avoid over-committing the specification and provide
 * flexibility for implementing the UML specification.
 *
 * Note: there are several concerns about this new API.
 *
 * - is it safe?
 *   Errors will throw exceptions; OTI uses instead a fail-safe/fail-lazy pattern so that OTI functions should never throw (unless there is a bug)
 *   and instead functions return either a successful value or an abnormal error (which can wrap zero or more exceptions)
 *
 * - is it necessary?
 *   Most of the functionality is available in the OTI/Core API already; see below for details
 * 
 * - is it appropriate? 
 *   getExtendedElements is the least appropriate because the signatures incompletely reflects the essential aspects of
 *   the semantics of stereotypes defined in OMG UML 2.5, section 12.3.3:
 *
 *   Any metaclass referenced by a metaclassReference or contained in a Package referenced by metamodelReference 
 *   of the closest Profile directly or indirectly containing a Stereotype can be extended by the Stereotype.
 *   A Stereotype may be contained in a Package in which case the metaclasses available for extension are those referenced 
 *   by the closest parent Profile containing the Package.
 *
 *   The OMG UML 2.5 specification is silent about applying a Stereotype that does not have a containing Profile nor about 
 *   applying a Stereotype to an Element without a ProfileApplication relationship from the Stereotype's Profile.
